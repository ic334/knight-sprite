# 8x8 Knight Sprite Generator

A simple Python script to generate an 8x8 pixel knight sprite using NumPy and PIL. Inspired by GitHub’s default blocky profile pictures, this script allows you to create a personalized, retro-style knight avatar.

## Features
- Generates an 8x8 pixel knight sprite
- Uses a customizable color palette
- Saves the sprite as a PNG file
- Easily editable to create different pixel art characters

## Requirements
- Python 3
- NumPy
- Pillow (PIL)

## Usage

Run the script to generate and save an 8x8 knight sprite:

```
python knight_sprite.py
```

This will generate knight_sprite_8x8.png in the working directory.

## Customization

Modify the ``knight_sprite`` array to change the design and adjust the ``palette`` dictionary to use different colors.

# Inspiration

This project was inspired by GitHub’s default profile pictures, which are blocky and symmetric. I wanted to create my own pixelated knight avatar for a personal touch.
